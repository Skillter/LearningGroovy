I really hated doing this 1 specific exercise in the project.
Although I've learned not 5, but many more new useful things,
so nevertheless the benefits in terms of 1000 outweight the struggle I had to go through.
Adding those 3 numbers in the poem is super awkward, it sounds awkward, it looks awkward, and I hate it with passion.
